# Challenge-Design-Pattern
 Objective: The task involves applying structural and behavioral design patterns in JavaScript to develop a contact management system. This system should allow users to add, remove, list, and search for contacts by name. The system should include a Contact class with attributes for name, phone, and email, and a ContactManager class with methods for managing contacts. A simple command-line interface should be implemented for user interaction. Structural and behavioral design patterns should be used to ensure that the system can be easily extended in the future without modifying existing code, and that the contact search functionality can vary independently of the search algorithms.
